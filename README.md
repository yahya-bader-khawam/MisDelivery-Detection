# OCR-based-MisDelivery-Detection-in-Last-Mile-Application
This repo contains a class called LastMile() which can determine if drivers misdeliver packages which are supposed to be dropped at the correct designated addresses.

#### What is The Project All About?

There are plenty of courier companies that are responsible for delivering packages purchased by customers online. As known, each package is designated to a certain address set by the customer. However, often drivers misdeliver packages to a wrong address. This creates a loss for the courier company as it shoud compensate the customer for losing the package. Normally, this is tracked using the distance between the coordinates of the customer and the coordinate captured by the driver when a derlivery is done. However, tracking distance between coordinates is not enough since a package might misderlivered to a wrong address within the error range of the GPS device of the driver which includes the neighbours of the customers. This project tackle this problem by tracking the distance between the actual and captured coordinates in addition to the units numbers extracted from the customers' addresses images captured by the drivers. The extracted unit numbers from images are compared against the addresses provided by the customers.
